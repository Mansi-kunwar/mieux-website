    <h2 class="text_styling">What is a Private Cloud?</h2>
    <p class="text_styling">A Private Cloud is a computing environment dedicated to a single organization, offering exclusive access to computing resources, storage, and network infrastructure. Unlike public cloud models, it provides enhanced security, privacy, control, and **custom configurations, making it ideal for businesses with sensitive data and complex workloads.
